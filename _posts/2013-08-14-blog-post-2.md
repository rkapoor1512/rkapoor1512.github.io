This is a list of puzzles I have found interesting at various points in my life. 

## Puzzle 1
There is a square tabel with a coin on each corner. The table is behind a curtain and hidden from you. Your goal is to get all the coins to be heads up: at any point, if you have achieved the goal, you will be told about it, and win. 
The only way to affect the coins is to tell the person behind the curtain to flip as many coins as you like, in specified corners: a sample instruction might look like: 'flip the coins in teh top right and bottom left corners.' However, after every flip you orchestrate, the table is spun and ends up in random configuration you do not know. 

Design a series of moves that guarantees a win in a finite number of moves. 

Challenge: do the same for 3x3 grid of coins spun about its centre. Can you do this for a table shaped as an n-gon, with n coins?
