I am a Mathematics PhD student at <a href="https://math.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth</a> College. I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BA in Mathematics in 2023, and spent a year as an Exponent Fellow at the National Museum of Mathematics. 

My research uses tools from operator algebras/functional analysis to study climate models. I am also interested in geometric measure theory and AI alignment research. In a past life, I was involved with quantitative trading and molecular engineering research.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, running, rock climbing, and making espresso. I am also involved in parliamentary debate, and competed for the Chicago Debate Society.
