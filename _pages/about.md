I am a Mathematics PhD student at <a href="https://math.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth</a>. I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BA in Mathematics in 2023, and spent a year as an Exponent Fellow at the National Museum of Mathematics in New York City. I call Bangalore, India home. 

I am advised by <a href="https://giannakis.host.dartmouth.edu/">Dimitris Giannakis</a>, and my research uses ergodic theory and functional analysis to study climate models. I am also interested in geometric measure theory and AI alignment research. In a past life, I was involved with quantitative trading and molecular engineering research.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and making espresso. I am also involved in parliamentary debate, and competed for the Chicago Debate Society. 

Over the years, I have been fortunate to receive advice and mentorship from an incredible set of people, and I'd love to pay it forward. If anything here catches your fancy, drop me an email!
