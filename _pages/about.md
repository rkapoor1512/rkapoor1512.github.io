Hi, this website is currently being built. 

I'm a mathematics PhD student at Dartmouth College starting in Fall 2024. I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BA in Mathematics in 2023, and spent a year as an Exponent Fellow at the National Museum of Mathematics. I also have experience in quantitative trading and molecular engineering research. My academic interests are in geometric measure theory, functional analysis, and AI alignment research. 

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, running, rock climbing, and making espresso. I was also involved in parliamentary debate, and competed for the Chicago Debate Society.
